        <p>Hello! I'm the author and creator of the website shitik.com. Initially, this site served as my portfolio and a platform for sharing my thoughts.
            As I read books, watch movies, and study science, my thoughts have grown so numerous that I decided to create additional sections on my website and start sharing knowledge with others. I'm eager to pursue soon. Here, you'll also find my personal books, travel photos, and much more.</p>

        <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
        <p>I'm a programmer by education, style, and lifestyle. Currently, I develop software for financial and business projects. I've been with my current company for over 7 years, advancing from a regular employee to the CTO.</p>
        <p>From 2012 to 2014, I developed desktop applications for Windows.<br>
            Since 2014, I've focused primarily on web development. Between 2014 and 2017, I worked at a Minsk web studio, contributing to over a hundred projects. By 2017, I stopped counting my small and medium-sized projects.<br>
            Starting in 2017, I began working on a financial-economic website that has since evolved into a major project. During this time, I progressed from a middle programmer to the company's lead developer. Additionally, I've taken on several other large and intriguing projects in this field.</p>
        <p>During college, I explored Assembler, Visual Basic, Pascal, C, C++, C#, Delphi, JavaScript, and PHP, with most projects written in Delphi while actively studying PHP.</p>
        <p>In university, I delved into Java, shifting focus from Delphi to C++ Builder. I watched numerous YouTube videos to enhance my theoretical and practical skills. By this time, I was actively engaged in web development, gaining experience as both a back-end and front-end developer.</p>
        <p>I've read dozens of books on various programming languages, technologies, databases, concepts, and approaches. Since 2021, I weekly listen to <a href="/en/blog/podcasts" target="_blank">podcasts</a> and read articles to stay abreast of the latest IT events and news. Due to the nature of my work projects, I have a solid understanding of technical SEO aspects.</p>

        <h2 id="travel">Traveling</h2>
        <p>I began traveling actively only in 2019 and have since visited 12 countries. Some trips are detailed in blog posts, such as those about <a href="/en/blog/trip-to-azerbaijan" target="_blank">Azerbaijan</a> and <a href="/en/blog/trip-to-georgia" target="_blank">Georgia</a>, as well as a journey to <a href="ru/blog/trip-to-bali" target="_blank">Bali</a> via China. I plan to enhance the travel section on the site and publish more there, but currently, the most active platform for sharing travel experiences is my <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/shitik.sasha" target="_blank">Instagram account</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="run">Running</h2>
        <p>For over 8 years, I've been running outdoors, covering more than 1,500 km in total. I've completed over 200 runs, whether in the heat of summer or the cold of winter. The <a href="/en/blog" target="_blank">blog</a> regularly features posts about running.<br>
            <a href="/en/blog/run-2024">Running results in 2024</a><br>
            <a href="/en/blog/run-2023">Running statistics for 2023</a><br>

            <a href="/en/blog/run-2021" target="_blank">Running results for 2021</a><br>

            <a href="/en/blog/run" target="_blank">New personal running record</a>
        </p>

        <h2 id="football">Football</h2>
        <p>"Once AC Milan flows through your veins, it'll flow forever in your blood." – Rui Costa. This happened to me in 2002-2003 when Milan won the Champions League. Since then, I've not only watched football but also actively played it. However, in recent years, due to time constraints, my involvement with football has been limited to watching matches without participating in games.</p>


        <h2 id="collection">Collecting</h2>
        <p>As a child, I collected Pokémon chips—about a thousand of them—along with kopecks and coins, though I no longer remember the exact number. I also gathered football posters and magazine inserts, accumulating several hundred. By the way, I kept football magazines and newspapers until recently, and their number also reached several hundred. Back in the days without the internet, magazines and television were the only sources of football-related information.</p>
        <p>Currently, my collections consist of two types: ballpoint pens and puzzles. The puzzles are usually large, typically around 1000 pieces.</p>


        <h2 id="books">Books</h2>
        <p>It so happens that I read a lot of books. Half of them are about technologies and programming languages. The IT field is vast and rapidly evolving, so continuous learning is essential. The other half consists of books on a wide range of topics: self-development, psychology, health, planning, financial well-being, and other genres.</p>
        <p>Every year in my <a href="/en/blog" target="_blank">blog</a>, I write a report in the form of a short article about the books I have read over the past year:<br>
            <a href="/en/blog/books-2024" target="_blank">Reading results in 2024</a><br>
            <a href="/en/blog/books-2023" target="_blank">Book statistics for 2023</a><br>
            <a href="/en/blog/books-2022" target="_blank">Books read in 2022</a><br>
            <a href="/en/blog/books-2021" target="_blank">Books read in 2021</a><br>
            <a href="/en/blog/books-2020" target="_blank">One-third of a hundred books in 11 months</a>
        </p>
        <p>I also plan to create a dedicated section on my website where I will publish detailed book reviews. For now, all book reviews, in the form of short comments, can be found on my Instagram account dedicated to books.</p>

        <h2 id="productivity">Productivity and Planning</h2>
        <p>I have been actively applying a project-based approach to my personal life for about five years now, and it has helped me achieve my goals. I truly believe that I have a good understanding of this concept, as I have read several dozen books on the subject.
        As a result, I have written articles such as <a href="/en/blog/planning" target="_blank">"Planning as a Degree of Goal Achievement"</a> and <a href="/en/blog/scrum-and-sprint-life" target="_blank">"Living by Scrum with Sprints."</a> Additionally, I authored a book on productivity titled <a href="/en/blog/my-first-book" target="_blank">"How a Humanities Major Can Master Productivity and Planning?"</a> and am currently working on my second book.</p>
        <p>In the near future, I plan to create a section on my website for publishing books and making them available directly on my site.</p>

        <h2 id="space">Space and Science</h2>
        <p>I have been passionate about science and cosmology since my school years. Although I never pursued this professionally, my systematic interest in space over the past 15–20 years has given me a significantly deeper understanding than the average person, who often has no idea about the latest advancements in this field or how far technology has progressed. Because of this, I plan to publish articles on space and science, explaining complex topics in a simple and engaging way. A dedicated section for this will soon appear on my website. Unlike football, sports, or other areas where I have no idols, in science, I would say that my inspiration is Stephen Hawking. He was a brilliant modern scientist and science popularizer who, despite all his challenges, remains a true example of a love for life.</p>

        <h2 id="blog">Blog</h2>
        <p>I started my <a href="/en/blog" target="_blank">blog</a> about ten years ago, initially focusing on posts about programming. However, the field of development evolves so rapidly that my articles quickly became outdated.
            At the same time, I began reading more books, getting into planning, and diving deeper into space and science. As a result, the focus of my blog shifted, and the content became more engaging. There are no longer any programming-related posts.</p>


        <h2 id="movie">Cinema and Films</h2>
        <p>Since 2020, I’ve actively been watching <a href="/en/blog/movies-imdb" target="_blank">the IMDb Top 250 films</a>. I enjoyed it so much that I also started watching <a href="/en/blog/kinopoisk-250" target="_blank">the Top 250 films according to KinoPoisk</a>. After watching films from both IMDb and KinoPoisk lists, I wrote separate articles where I thoroughly analyzed many of them.
        In addition to regular viewings, I also watched and read numerous film reviews, which helped me better understand the director's intent and message. In recent years, I’ve frequently been going to the cinema for premieres.
            In the near future, I plan to create a separate section on my website for this and write reviews on both new and even older films.</p>

        <h2 id="music">Music</h2>
        <p>The only idol I mentioned earlier was Hawking, but there is another one, and this person is from the music world. He is just as determined as Hawking, a person who worked towards his goals until the last days of his life. This person is Freddie Mercury. For me, Queen's songs are unparalleled, and the only voice that comes close to Mercury’s is Klaus Meine.
            As you may have guessed, I love rock music, especially international rock, and particularly the music of the '80s. However, I also enjoy listening to modern and domestic rock music.</p>
